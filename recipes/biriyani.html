        <strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
          <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Steps</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Mix in the
            yogurt and vinegar. Place the onion in the skillet, and cook until
            tender. Mix in the garlic, ginger paste, green chile peppers, and
            tomatoes. Cook and stir until tomatoes are tender. Season with garam
            masala, mint, salt, and pepper, and mix in the cilantro.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the chicken in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
            and continue cooking 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
            chicken juices run clear.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring the water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Mix in the bay
            leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cinnamon. Season with salt
            to taste. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate pot, alternate the rice and chicken mixture in layers,
            topping with rice. Sprinkle with the food coloring, and mix to
            serve.
